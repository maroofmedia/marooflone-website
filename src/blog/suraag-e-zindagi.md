***We often treat peace like a destination. We think it is a place on a map.***

We tell ourselves, "If I can just finish this job, I will be peaceful." Or, "If I can just move to a quiet house in the mountains, I will finally relax." We spend our lives trying to arrange the world around us. We try to silence the noise, control the chaos, and fix every problem.

But this is a trap. It is a paradox.

We try to find silence outside, but we forget that the loudest noise usually comes from our own heads. You can sit in an empty, silent room, yet your mind can be screaming with worry, regret, or fear. On the other hand, you can stand in the middle of a crowded, noisy market and feel completely calm.

Why? Because the world is not a window; it is a mirror.

If you are angry inside, a beautiful sunset will look boring to you. If you are fearful inside, a friendly stranger will look like a threat. We do not see the world as it is; we see the world as *we* are.

Trying to find peace by fixing the world is like trying to smooth out the waves in the ocean with your hands. The more you fight the water, the more you disturb it. The ocean is naturally wild. The world is naturally chaotic. Things will break. Plans will fail. People will disappoint you. If your peace depends on everything being perfect, you will never be at peace.

So, stop trying to flatten the waves. Let the ocean be wild.

Real peace is not about stopping the storm outside; it is about finding the stillness inside. You cannot control the wind or the weather, but you can control your own boat. The moment you stop fighting the chaos of the world, you realize that the chaos cannot touch you.

The silence you are looking for is not in a distant land. It is buried deep within you, waiting to be found.

***Apne mann mein doob kar pa ja suraag-e-zindagi,
Tu agar mera nahin banta, na ban, apna to ban.***
